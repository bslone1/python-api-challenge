Below is the plot for Cloudiness vs. Latitude in the Southern Hemisphere, with latitude on the x-axis and percentage of cloudiness on the y-axis. We can see that cities closer to the equater (a latitude of 0) generally tend towards less cloudiness. This is illustrated by the best fit line on the plot.

Below is the plot for Max Tempurature vs. Latitude in the Southern Hemisphere, with latitude on the x-axis and max temp (F) on the y-axis. We can see that cities closer to the equater (a latitude of 0) have generally much higher tempuratures than cities further away. This is illustrated by the best fit line on the plot.

Below is the plot for Max Tempurature vs. Latitude in the Northern Hemisphere, with latitude on the x-axis and max tempurature (F) on the y-axis. We can see that cities further away from the equater tend to be much colder than cities closer to the equater (latitude of 0). This is illustrated by the best fit line on the plot. This finding is also corroborated by the second trend observerd in Max. Tempurature vs. Latutde in the Southern Hemisphere plot.
